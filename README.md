SHA-256 Hash Comparison Project
In this project, I developed a Java program to analyze and compare the similarity between two randomly generated sentences
based on their SHA-256 hash values. The program reads names and countries from external text files, constructs sentences like
“Name is in Country,” and generates their respective SHA-256 hashes. By converting these hashes to character arrays, the program
calculates the number of matching characters at corresponding positions to determine similarity. This project deepened my understanding
of cryptographic hashing and sharpened my problem-solving abilities, especially in file handling, string manipulation, and the practical
application of hashing algorithms.
